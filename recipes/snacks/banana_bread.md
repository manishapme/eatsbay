# Banana Bread
Inspired by https://chezus.com/2011/04/14/super-moist-banana-bread/, but made healthier.

## 
Ingredients:

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (or 1 cup almond meal + 1/2 cup tapioca flour)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 cup coconut oil (halved from original)
- 1/4 cup of yogurt â€“ full fat (Straus Plain)
- 1/3 cup brown sugar ( or 1/4 tsp liquid stevia)
- 1 egg
- 3 medium-size bananas (overripe)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1/4 c chia seeds

## Directions:

1. Heat oven to 350.
2. Grease loaf pan with coconut oil and dusting of flour.
3. Sift the dry ingredients together in a large mixing bowl;  set aside.
4. In a mixing bowl, beat the butter or coconut oil on medium speed, until soft;  about 1 minute.
5. Add the yogurt, and continue beating on medium speed, for 3 minutes.
6. Add the sugar, and mix at medium speed, until fluffy;  3 minutes.
7. Add 3 bananas and vanilla and mix for another minute.
8. Add the egg and mix for a minute.
9. Add chia seeds to liquid. They absorb moisture. Let set 15 minutes before combining with dry ingredients.
10. Add the dry ingredients, mix on medium speed, until combined;  about 2 minutes.
11. Pour into the loaf pan.
12. Bake for 45-55 minutes.  Each oven is different, start checking at 45 minutes.  You want the bread to be golden brown.  A knife will come out clean when you slide it into the middle of the loaf.
13. Remove from the oven and let sit 20 minutes before slicing.
