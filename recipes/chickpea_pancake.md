I've only made this once. Will probably like it spicier. Will try that next time I make it.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup chickpea flour sifted (also known as garbanzo flour or besan)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon fine grain sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes or cayenne(optional)
- 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons water
- 1/2 cup frozen peas (thawed to room temp)

## Directions
1. Preheat a 10-inch skillet over medium heat.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the chickpea flour, garlic powder, salt, pepper, baking powder, and red pepper.
3. Add the water and whisk well until no clumps remain and batter is frothy.
4. When the skillet is pre-heated (a drop of water should sizzle on the pan), add lots of ghee to pan.
5. Pour on all of the batter (if making 1 large pancake) and quickly spread it out all over the pan.
6. After 30 seconds, sprinkle with peas.
7. Cook for about 5-6 minutes on one side (timing will depend on how hot your pan is).
8. Flip and cook other side for another 5 min.

Would be great with a chutney. Still have to enter measurements for mom's cilantro chutney. Here as placeholder:
Blend: Cilantro, coconut, salt, red pepper, cashews, mango powder, cumin, water
