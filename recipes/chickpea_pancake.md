I've only made this once. Will probably like it spicier. Make it in the oven like skillet cornbread.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup chickpea flour sifted (also known as garbanzo flour or besan)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon fine grain sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes or cayenne(optional)
- 1 cup + 4 tablespoons water
- 1 cup frozen peas (thawed to room temp)

## Directions
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the chickpea flour, garlic powder, salt, pepper, baking powder, and red pepper.
2. Add the water and whisk well until no clumps remain and batter is frothy.
3. Preheat a cast iron 10-inch skillet in oven at 375.
4. Generously grease skillet with ghee
5. Mix peas into batter.
6. Pour batter into skillet and bake for 20 min

Would be great with a chutney. Still have to enter measurements for mom's cilantro chutney. Here as placeholder:
Blend: 
- Cilantro, 1 bunch of leaves, remove stems
- 1/4 cup coconut
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper or fresh serrano
- 1/4 cup cashews
- 1/2 teaspoon mango powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 2 tbs water, more as needed
