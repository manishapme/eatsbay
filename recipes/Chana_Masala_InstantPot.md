# Ingredients

- 3 TBL vegetable oil, divided
- 1 onion, ﬁnely chopped
- Water
- 2 tsp mustard seeds
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 2 tsp Garam Masala (check in freezer)
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp kosher salt (approx.)
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 2 tsp freshly squeezed lemon juice (approx.)
- 2 tsp minced garlic
- 1 tsp minced ginger
- 1 serrano chile, minced
- 1 can (28 oz) diced tomatoes (with juice)
- 2 cups dried chickpeas, rinsed
- 2 cups chopped greens (spinach, beet greens, mustard greens, mehta)
- 1 cup ﬁnely chopped fresh cilantro

# Instructions

1. Using the Sauté function on High, heat 2 tablespoons oil in the inner pot for 1 minute, until shimmering. Add the onions; cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, occasionally adding 1 tablespoon water if the bottom of the pot gets brown and the onion begins to stick. Cook the onion until deeply browned.

2. Push the onion to the side of the pot. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and heat it for 1 minute, until shimmering. Stir in the mustard seeds, coriander, garam masala, cumin, salt and turmeric; cook for about 1 minute, until the mustard seeds begin to pop. Stir in the lemon juice, garlic, ginger and chile; cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.

3. Add the diced tomatoes (with juice) and 2 cups water; stir, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Stir in the chickpeas. Secure the lid and cook on high pressure for 35 minutes.

4. Once the cooking is complete, release the pressure naturally for 5 minutes, then quick-release the remaining pressure. Check to make sure the chickpeas are soft enough for your liking; if they are still too hard, cook them on high pressure for another 5 minutes.

5. Remove the lid and stir in the chopped greens, adding a little more water if the stew is dry. Using the Sauté setting on High, simmer until the greens are wilted, about 2 minutes. Taste and add more salt and lemon juice, if needed. Stir in the cilantro and serve.
