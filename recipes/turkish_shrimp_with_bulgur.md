- 1 15 oz. can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 1 14.5 oz. can fire roasted diced tomatoes
- ¾ cup vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more, to taste
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more, to taste
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint

## Ingredients: Grilled shrimp kebabs:
- 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon sweet paprika
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4 wooden skewers

## Directions: Bulgur
1. In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Add tomato paste, cumin, cinnamon and chili flakes and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
3. Add bulgur and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Then add chickpeas, tomatoes with juice, chicken broth, salt and pepper. Stir and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the bulgur is tender, 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat; let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
4. Stir in mint and parsley. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.

## Directions: Shrimp
1. Place the shrimp in a resealable plastic bag.
2. In a medium bowl, combine the olive oil, oregano, garlic powder, sweet paprika, salt and pepper.
3. Add the sauce to the bag with the shrimp, seal and transfer to the refrigerator. Let marinate for at least 15 minutes and up to 2 hours, flipping the bag twice.
4. When you're ready to cook the kebabs, add lemon juice to bag and shake vigorously.
5. Remove the shrimp from the sauce and thread onto 4 skewers.
6. Heat a grill pan over medium heat. Place skewers in the pan and cook, flipping once, until grill marks are visible and shrimp is opaque in the center, 4-6 minutes.
7. Remove kebabs from pan and serve with Turkish bulgur pilaf.
