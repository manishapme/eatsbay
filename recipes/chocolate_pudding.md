# Chocolate Pudding

From this recipe: https://www.paleorunningmomma.com/easy-paleo-vegan-chocolate-pudding/

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups organic coconut cream from a can*
- 1/2 cup raw cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
- 6 Tbsp pure maple syrup 6-8 Tbsp depending on how sweet you want it
- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- generous pinch fine grain sea salt

## Directions
1. In a small saucepan over low heat, whisk together the coconut cream, cacao, and maple syrup (start with 6 Tbsp, or even less if you want a very dark chocolate pudding) until smooth. I used a small whisk to get everything nice and smooth.
2. The coconut cream will melt and the maple and cacao should combine well to create a smooth silky mixture. Continue to cook and stir over low/med heat for about 2 minutes, or until the mixture just begins to come to a boil with small bubbles.
3. Remove from heat at this point, and stir in the salt and vanilla. Taste, and add a bit more maple if you'd like a sweeter pudding. You can pour the mixture into individual containers/bowls to chill and set, or simply in one larger bowl only and divide later on.
4. Cover and refrigerate until set, or overnight for a thick creamy pudding. Makes about 4 servings. I love my pudding with a big dollop of coconut whipped cream on top! Enjoy!
