# Ingredients 

- Kosher salt, as needed, plus 1/2 teaspoon
- 1 onion
- 8 oz. mushrooms
- 1 large head cauliflower, cut into small florets
- Vegetable oil
- 2/3 cup of soy milk with 1/3 cup of olive oil (or 1 cup heavy cream)
- 2 ounces cream cheese, cut into small pieces
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar, plus 1/2 cup for topping the casserole
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 cup peas
- Can of tuna

# Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the water with salt.
2. Coat the baking dish with vegetable oil.
3. Cook the cauliflower in the boiling water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well and pat between several layers of paper towels to dry. Transfer the cauliflower to the baking dish and set aside.
4. Sautee onion and mushroom
5. Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan, and whisk in the cream cheese and mustard until smooth. Stir in 1 cup of the cheese, peas, tuna, onion, mushroom, salt, pepper, and garlic and whisk just until the cheese melts, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, pour over the cauliflower, and stir to combine. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese and bake until browned and bubbly hot, about 15 minutes. 
5. Serve over polenta or quinoa.
