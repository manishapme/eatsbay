# Baked Brie with Cranberry Sauce

Sourced from https://downshiftology.com/recipes/baked-brie-with-cranberry-sauce/.

## Ingredients
- 8 ounce round Brie cheese
- 2 tablespoons roughly chopped pistachios (optional)
- Optional garnish: fresh herb sprigs and orange zest (optional)
- 12-ounce package fresh or frozen cranberries
- ½ cup sugar or more as desired
- ½ cup orange juice
- ½ cup water
- orange zest, optional

## Directions
First make the cranberry sauce at least 1 hour before ready to serve, or the night before.
1. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the water, orange juice, and honey and bring to a boil.
2. Add the cranberries and give everything stir.
3. Simmer the sauce. Bring the mixture back to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.
4. Let it simmer for 5 to 10 minutes while stirring occasionally. The cranberries will burst (that's what you want) and the sauce will start to thicken.
5. Turn the heat off and let it cool for 15 minutes. Then transfer it to a container and place it in the fridge to chill and thicken up.

Bake Brie
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Place the Brie on a parchment-lined baking sheet or in a corning ware serving dish.
3. Top with the cranberry sauce, then bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the cheese is soft and melty.
4. Serve. Sprinkle the pistachios on top and garnish with fresh herbs.
5. Serve with simple crackers.
