# Butternut Squash Soup

## Ingredients
- 1 medium-sized fresh butternut squash. 
- 2 carrot
- 2 Granny Smith apples
- 1 onion
- 2 c Vegetable stock
- coconut milk: For your broth.  (We’ll stir the coconut milk in at the very end.)
- 2 cloves garlic
season to taste with sage, salt, black pepper, cayenne, cinnamon and nutmeg If you don’t have fresh sage on hand, feel free to use a pinch of dried.  (And if you do have fresh sage, I also love to fry up a few extra leaves and use them as a garnish on top.)  Also feel free to add more or less cayenne to taste.
Your choice of garnishes: I like to drizzle on some extra coconut milk, maybe sprinkle of toasted pepitas, and a sprinkle of extra black pepper and/or smoked paprika.  Mom’s version called for sprinkling cayenne on top.  Or I’ve included lots of other ideas for fun garnishes below.
 

## Instructions
To make this Butternut Squash Soup recipe on the stovetop, simply…

1. Combine your ingredients (minus the coconut milk) in a large stockpot.  For extra flavor, I recommend sautéing the onion and garlic beforehand in a tablespoon of olive oil.  But that step is optional if you’d like to save some time.
2. Cook squash first then add carrots until tender and apples last. Add vegetable stock and cook the soup until it reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 20-30 minutes, or until the butternut squash can be easily mashed with a fork. Add 1/2 can of coconut cream/milk. Add seasoning mix
3. Blend.  Either use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth.  Or you can transfer the soup in two batches to a traditional blender and puree it there.  (Just be extremely careful blending hot liquids; you do not want the blender to be too full.)
4. Taste and season.  Add extra salt, pepper and/or cayenne if needed, to taste.
5. Serve and enjoy!  Garnished with fried fresh sage leaves or any of your favorite toppings
