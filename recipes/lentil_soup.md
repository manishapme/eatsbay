# Lentil Soup
Mostly from “The New Moosewood Cookbook,” by Mollie Katzen.

## Ingredients
- 3 cups dry lentils (or 1 1/2 cups quinoa and 1 1/2 cups lentils)
- 7 cups water
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 4 - 6 medium cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 cups chopped onion
- 4 stalks celery, chopped
- 4 medium carrots, sliced or diced
- 1 teaspoon basil
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- Lots of freshly ground black pepper
- 2 to 3 medium-sized ripe tomatoes (totally fine to leave this out)
- 1 teaspoon Dragonfly Hot Chili Oil (for a kick)

## Directions
1. Place lentils, water and salt in a kettle. Bring to a boil, lower heat to the slowest possible simmer, and cook quietly, partially covered, for 20 to 30 minutes. If using half quinoa, add for last 15 minutes.
1. Add vegetables (except tomatoes), herbs (if using) and black pepper. Partially cover and let simmer peacefully another 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
1. Heat a medium saucepan of water to boiling, Drop in the tomatoes for 10 seconds, then take them out, peel off the skins and squeeze out the seeds. Chop the remaining pulp and add to the soup. Let the soup cook for at least 5 minutes more.

Can also cook lentils and quinoa in an instantpot. Then sautee all the veggies and spices in a little oil. Add cooked lentils and simmer for 10 min.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
