# Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- Medium head green cabbage (about 1 1/2 lbs), cut into large shreds
- 1 cup onion, chopped
- 3 stalks celery, chopped

# Instructions

Heat the olive oil and butter in an extra large ovenproof skillet over medium heat.
Once heated, add the cabbage, onion, celery, garlic, sea salt and black pepper to the pan.
Sauté until the vegetables are crisp tender – about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms
Mix in the dill, mustard powder, lemon zest, and lemon juice.
Pour the heavy cream and 1 cup Parmesan cheese into the pan. Mix in and keep stirring until the cheese has melted and combined with the heavy cream.
Reduce heat to medium low and let simmer to allow the sauce to thicken.
Once the sauce has started to thicken, stir in the tuna and the peas.
Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan over the top of the dish and transfer to the oven.

Broil on high for 3-5 minutes or until the Parmesan on top has made a golden brown crust.
