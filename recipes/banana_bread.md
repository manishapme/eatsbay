# Banana Bread
Inspired by https://chezus.com/2011/04/14/super-moist-banana-bread/, but made healthier.

## 
Ingredients:

- 1 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 cup coconut oil
- 1 cup of yogurt cheese â€“ full fat (Straus Plain)
- 2/3 cup agave
- 1 egg
- 2-3 medium-size bananas
- 1/2 c Flax Meal
- 1/4 c raw Wheat Germ

## Directions:

1. Heat oven to 350.
2. Line a loaf pan, with parchment paper.  I lightly butter the sides to prevent any sticking.
3. Sift the dry ingredients together in a large mixing bowl;  set aside.  I use a fine sieve as I do not own a sifter.
4. In a mixing bowl, beat the butter or coconut oil on medium speed, until soft;  about 1 minute.
5. Add the cream cheese or yogurt cheese, and continue beating on medium speed, for 3 minutes.
6. Add the sugar, and mix at medium speed, until fluffy;  3 minutes.
7. Add 3 bananas and vanilla and mix for another minute.
8. Add the egg and mix for a minute.  
9. Add the dry ingredients, mix on medium speed, until combined;  about 2 minutes.
10. Pour into the loaf pan.
11. Bake for 45-55 minutes.  Each oven is different, start checking at 45 minutes.  You want the bread to be golden brown.  A knife will come out clean when you slide it into the middle of the loaf.
12. Remove from the oven and let sit 20 minutes before slicing.
