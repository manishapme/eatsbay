## Ingredients

1 unbaked Flaky Pie Crust (preferably keto)*
4 large eggs
1/4 cup (30g) cornstarch
1 (14 ounce) can full fat coconut milk*
1 cup (240ml) half-and-half or almond milk or more coconut milk
1 1/2 teaspoons coconut stevia
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup (80g) shredded coconut
2 Tablespoons (30g) coconut oil, softened to room temperature
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
optional: 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract

## Instructions
### Pie crust
1. Use a fully pre-baked piecrust
2. Cook the day before so it is cool at time of recipe

### Make the coconut filling: 
1. Whisk the eggs and cornstarch together. Set aside. 
2. Whisk the coconut milk, half-and-half, stevia, and salt together in a medium saucepan over medium heat. 
   Whisking occasionally, bring to a boil. 
3. Boil for 2 minutes, then reduce temperature to medium-low heat.
4. Once boiling, take 1/2 cup of mix and in a slow and steady stream, whisk into the egg and cornstarch mixture. 
   Keep those egg yolks moving so they donâ€™t scramble. 
5. In a slow and steady stream, pour and whisk the egg yolk mixture into the pot.
6. Whisk and cook for 1 minute and 30 seconds.
   Remove from heat and stir in the coconut, coconut butter, vanilla, and coconut extract (if using).
7. Pour warm filling into cooled pie crust.
8. Cover tightly with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding (to prevent a skin from forming) and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight until chilled and thickened.

Optional serve with whipped cream on top
