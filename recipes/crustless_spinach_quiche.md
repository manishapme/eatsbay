# Crustless Spinach Quiche
Inspired by https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/crustless-spinach-quiche/

## Ingredients

- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and well drained
- 6 large eggs
- .5 cups shredded Muenster or Monterey Jack cheese
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper

## Directions

In a large skillet, saute onion and mushrooms in oil until tender. Add spinach and ham; cook and stir until the excess moisture is evaporated. Cool slightly. Beat eggs; add cheese and mix well. Stir in spinach mixture and pepper; blend well. Spread evenly into a greased 9-in. pie plate or quiche dish. Bake at 350Â° for 40-45 minutes or until a knife inserted in center comes out clean.

### Test Kitchen Tips
To ensure perfectly cooked quiche, start checking early to see whether it's done. Baking times are great guidelines, but because every oven heats differently, we recommend taking an early look, especially for cakes, cookies, muffins and delicate egg-based dishes.
For cheese that's extra melty, shred or grate it yourself.
