2. Add the chopped sweet potatoes, sliced carrots, and optional chopped bell pepper to the pan and cook until the onions are soft, about 5 to 6 minutes.
3. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add in all of the remaining ingredients, stirring to combine well.
4. Allow your chili to simmer, partially covered and stirring occasionally over medium-low heat, for about 20 to 25 minutes, until the flavors have mingled and the sweet potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers are soft.
5. Serve in a bowl topped with your favorite chili toppings and enjoy.
6. Consider a toppings bar for your black bean chili, including salsa, chopped cilantro, sliced green onions, diced avocado, and crushed gluten-free corn tortilla chips. Sour cream, shredded cheese, or vegan substitutes might also be offered (checking labels if gluten-free foods are desired).
