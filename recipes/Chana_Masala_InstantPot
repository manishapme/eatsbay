# Instructions

Using the Sauté function on High, heat 2 tablespoons (30 mL) oil in the inner pot for 1 minute, until shimmering. Add the onions; cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, occasionally adding 1 tablespoon (15 mL) water if the bottom of the pot gets brown and the onion begins to stick. Cook the onion until deeply browned.

Push the onion to the side of the pot. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) oil and heat it for 1 minute, until shimmering. Stir in the mustard seeds, coriander, garam masala, cumin, salt and turmeric; cook for about 1 minute, until the mustard seeds begin to pop. Stir in the amchur, garlic, ginger and chile; cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.

Add the diced tomatoes (with juice) and 2 cups (500 mL) water; stir, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Stir in the chickpeas. Secure the lid and cook on high pressure for 35 minutes.

Once the cooking is complete, release the pressure naturally for 5 minutes, then quick-release the remaining pressure. Check to make sure the chickpeas are soft enough for your liking; if they are still too hard, cook them on high pressure for another 5 minutes.

Remove the lid and stir in the chopped greens, adding a little more water if the stew is dry. Using the Sauté setting on High, simmer until the greens are wilted, about 2 minutes. Taste and add more salt and lemon juice, if needed. Stir in the cilantro and serve.
