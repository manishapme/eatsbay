# Moosewood Mushroom Curry

## Ingredients
- 2 Tbs butter or margerine (I used olive oil)
- 2 cups chopped onion
- 3 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
- 1 tsp. turmeric
- 1 tsp. powdered ginger
- 1 tsp. mustard seeds
- 1/2 tsp. cloves or allspice
- 1 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 cup chopped celery
- 1 1/2 lbs mushrooms, coarsely chopped
- 3 medium sized tomatoes, chopped
- 2 medium tart apples, chopped
- 1/2 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
- 1 Tbs. honey (optional, but I obviously took the option)
- 3 to 4 Tbs lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp Cayenne, to taste

1) Heat the butter olive oil in a large, deep skillet. Add onions and garlic, and saute over medium heat. When you get bored After a few minutes, add the spices and salt. Saute another 5 to 8 minutes, or until you can't stand it anymore the onions are soft.

2) Add celery and mushrooms. Mix well, cover, and simmer another 8 to 10 minutes. Attempt to entertain your roommate by shouting "simma down, simma down", but realize she doesn't think it's funny. (To be honest, neither do you.) Stir occasionally. You can add up to 1/2 cup of water to prevent sticking. (I'm not sure what happens if you don't add the water, but I wasn't about to find out.)

3) When the celery is slightly tender, add tomatoes, apple, coconut, honey, and lemon juice. Cover and cook until everything is tender but not mushy. (Ew.) Let sit for about 10 minutes before serving. Serve over instant brown rice.
