# Keto Chocolate Chip Cookies
I cannot find where I originally saw this recipe. It's still a work in progress.

## Ingredients
- 2 egg, room temp
- 1 1/2 tsp stevia
- 1/3 cup coconut oil, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups almond flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 - 3/4 cup Lilyâ€™s dark chocolate chips
- 1-2 tablespoons coconut flour (OPTIONAL) - only if you want them fluffier ** Haven't tried this yet

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees and line cookie sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, coconut oil, stevia and vanilla.
3. In a separate medium bowl, combine almond flour, baking soda and salt and mix well.
4. Add butter mixture to almond flour mixture and mix well with hand beater.
5. Lastly, add chocolate chips and finish mixing.
6. Form chocolate chip cookie dough into small balls using melon baller onto sheet.
7. Bake for 10-12 minutes and let cool on counter.
Note: Also tried making it in a pan and cutting like small brownies for moister consistency
